Hi, welcome to my page on Github.

## About me

I am doing research in computational biophysics. My interests include functional mechanisms of DNA-protein binding, multi-scale organization of the genome, liquid-liquid phase separation in gene expression, and modeling of biomolecules in molecular dynamics simulations. I write code for MD softwares [GENESIS](https://www.r-ccs.riken.jp/labs/cbrt/) and [CafeMol](https://www.cafemol.org/).

I used to be a free software fanatic (FSF), with many experiences of using various Linux distributions. But now I use paid softwares as much as possible to save time and to focus more on other interesting things.

In order to participate in a sport without any physical contact, I started practicing the Rubik’s cube from 2009, and I broke the Chinese national record for the 2×2×2 cube in a game in 2010. But I lost the passion to keep practicing since then. You can find my official records from [World Cube Association](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2009TANC02).
