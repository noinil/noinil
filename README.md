Hi, welcome to my page on Github.

## About me

I am doing research in computational biophysics. My interests include functional mechanisms of DNA-protein binding, multi-scale organization of the genome, liquid-liquid phase separation in gene expression, and modeling of biomolecules in molecular dynamics simulations. I write code for MD softwares [GENESIS](https://www.r-ccs.riken.jp/labs/cbrt/) and [CafeMol](https://www.cafemol.org/).

In addition to my professional work, I enjoy participating in non-contact sports, and in 2009, I began practicing the Rubik’s cube. My passion and dedication paid off in 2010, when I set a new Chinese national record for the 2×2×2 cube during a competition. Although I have not maintained the same level of practice since then, I am still proud of my achievement and encourage others to pursue their hobbies and passions outside of work. For those interested, my official records can be found on the [World Cube Association](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2009TANC02).
